1,Danielle,,"Okay, tell us a bit about yourself."
2,Erin,,"Yeah, I'm Erin. I am 22 years old. I just recently graduated from college, and right now I'm currently working as a research assistant and I'm also studying for an entrance exam for grad school."
3,Danielle,,Do you currently use Canva?
4,Erin,,"I'm currently not using Canva, but I have used it in the past."
5,Danielle,,"And when you did use Canva, did you ever use the pro plan?"
6,Erin,,"I did not, no."
7,Danielle,,"So, can you tell me about when and why you first started using Canva and what you mainly used it for?"
8,Erin,,"Yeah, I think I mainly started using Canva in college, and it was mostly to create flyers for club events and things of that sort. I also remember using Canva because they had presentation templates as well, so I used Canva for some projects."
9,Danielle,,"And when did you stop using Canva, and what changed that led you to stop using it or use it less often?"
10,Erin,,"I stopped using Canva because I graduated from school, and so there's not really a need for me to be creating flyers or club materials anymore since I'm no longer involved with those organizations."
11,Danielle,,"When you were using Canva in college, were you aware of the Canva Education platform and its features, as well as Canva for Campus and the partnerships with universities across the U.S.?"
12,Erin,,"I have not heard of those plans, no."
13,Danielle,,Were there any particular challenges or frustrations that made Canva harder to use or less valuable for you?
14,Erin,,I didn't find Canva to be particularly challenging to use. I found the usability of the website to be very easy and suited my needs when I needed to create a graphic quickly.
15,Danielle,,"But if you were to point out any pain points, what would you bring up?"
16,Erin,,"I think one of the pain points was when I was looking for certain graphics or icons. You weren’t able to sort between the Pro icons and the free plan. So if there was a way to filter between those two for icons, that would be helpful when looking for graphics I could actually use."
17,Danielle,,"And have you started using any other tools instead of Canva now that you’ve dropped off the platform? If yes, what do they offer that Canva didn’t?"
18,Erin,,I'm not using any graphic-making websites at the moment.
19,Danielle,,"It could also be digital materials in general—presentations, resume-building websites, any platform."
20,Erin,,"For my resume, I typically just use Word or Google Docs. I don’t need to be designing or adding icons, so there’s not a need for a site like Canva for that. As for presentations or projects, I haven't had to make anything that warrants a website like Canva. If I need to create a presentation, I typically use PowerPoint or Google Slides."
21,Danielle,,And can you articulate why you fall back on those platforms now that you're out of college?
22,Erin,,"I think it's mostly because it's built into what I typically use. I’m very comfortable with Google Drive because I've used it throughout my education. In college, we used Microsoft applications like Word, PowerPoint, and OneDrive, so I’m comfortable with those. Also, the people I work with on my research project use those applications too, so it's easy to collaborate since everyone already has institutional access."
23,Danielle,,Cool. So what university did you graduate from?
24,Erin,,I graduated from Emory.
25,Danielle,,"And Emory is a Canva for Campus partner, I believe. Did you ever hear of any of your peers, professors, or clubs utilizing Canva for Campus?"
26,Erin,,"I know that a few organizations used an upper level of Canva, but I'm not sure if that was directly related to the Canva for Campus plan."
27,Danielle,,"What would convince you to come back to using Canva in the future? Or why might you come back, if you foresee it happening?"
28,Erin,,"Right now there’s just not a need for me to use an application like Canva, because I’m not creating high-level graphics or documents that require design elements like icons or photographs. If I ever needed something that required more design, I might return to Canva."
29,Danielle,,"Great. Is there anything else you'd like to touch on in terms of difficulties you find, or about the transition from college to newly graduated life?"
30,Erin,,"Not particularly, no."
31,Danielle,,"Okay, great. Thanks."
