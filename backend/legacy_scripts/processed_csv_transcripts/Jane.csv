1,Navaa,,"So if you can just tell us a bit about yourself, name, age, what you do, what like your hobbies are, how you use Canva, sure."
2,Jane,,"Hi, my name is Jane. I'm a senior at UCLA, studying polysign econ in my free time, I like to do yoga. Shop go, you know, look at different cafes in LA with my friends, hang out with friends, watch movies."
3,Navaa,,"So would you describe yourself as, like, a current user of Canva to like, in in this moment as a student?"
4,Jane,,"We do use Canva, we do have our premium accounts. I cannot access it, to be honest. We use all the time for group projects, like earlier today, I was doing a group project for one of my classes, and we used Canva for slideshows. I think we've had Canva premium, like, accessible to students for either two or three years. Now, I know it wasn't a thing my freshman year, but definitely my sophomore or junior year. Like, everyone used to  access Canva Pro, um, yeah, I think it's pretty good. Like, I use it quite a bit, but I think some people actually defer to Google Slides."
5,Navaa,,"Yeah, that is kind of like a nice segue into the next question, which is, like, what's the biggest value that you would say Canva provides for you currently? And like, why do you use it? Why would you choose Canva for like, something specifically over like, Google Slides?"
6,Jane,,"Personally, I wouldn't choose it over Google Slides. I just think I know how to use Google, like the Google Cloud stuff, better than I know how to use other, secondary party stuff like Canva. But I guess if I were to use it, it would for it to be for, if I want to make an Instagram post for a club or something, or if I want to make a flyer for a club, or even if I want to do like a presentation or something, I think Canva offers a lot more like templates and stickers and to think make things more eye catching. I think that's why a lot of people like to use it."
7,Navaa,,"Yeah, absolutely like aesthetic value. Yeah, yeah. And then what are some reasons that you would like stop using Canva and have you switched to another design tool before? And if yes, which one and why it's just like stuff you don't like about it?"
8,Jane,,"Actually, today, I was having a hard time trying to add a text box to Canva. So I think that's kind of confusing. I think like, you can add a text box, then if you click out of it, it clicks away, or something, it's kind of hard to find. I think, honestly, that's it. Like, I think it's pretty intuitive. Honestly, I think it's very similar to Google, Google Slides or Outlook slides or whatever they're called, but just the organization of everything. But I think besides Canva, I haven't really used other stuff, like for UCLA. I've used Adobe Acrobat while I was at work over the summer. I would use it because my firm had it, so I would use it and have my Canva Pro."
9,Navaa,,"Um, and I guess this next question is, is very similar to the last one I just asked. But what do you find are your current pain points when using Canva? If there isn't anything, you don't have to answer it."
10,Jane,,"Um, I think the pain points, I don't really have one, to be honest. I think it's  what I was thinking about the text boxes. But I think that's just like, I don't use Canva as much as other people do. So that's just a skill issue that I personally have."
11,Navaa,,"I got you, if there's like, any like, like, logistical, like, account stuff as well that you've, like, run into?"
12,Jane,,"Well, I think like for us, you have Canva premium as a UCLA student, I just personally don't know how to access it and that's okay with me, because I don't really find the need to use it. Because it wasn't a thing my freshman year, I've never really switched over from, like, Google Docs or Google slides to Canva. And yeah, I don't really find the need to use Canva premium. So I don't really use it that much. I don't really, like, have a lot of skills or hardships with it, to be honest."
13,Navaa,,I got you. And then what are some changes or improvements that you think Canva should make to fit your needs specifically better.
14,Jane,,"I don't know. I honestly feel like Canva is a great, like, tool. It's just I haven't taken my own time to learn more about it. And that’s the main thing that, like, I don't really use Canva because I don't really see a need to most of the time, but I think like that, the fact that a lot of other people use Canva speaks to, you know, how it's grown and everything, and how it seems to be doing pretty well, and, like, suiting a lot of people's needs."
15,Navaa,,"Yeah. And I guess one last question is, do you know a lot of people that are accessing Canva premium, and are using Canva pro at UCLA specifically? Or is it just that the people you interact with, the people you work with, are also the same, where they don't really feel the need to use it?"
16,Jane,,"I think a lot of people I know use Canva Pro. I think, if it's free at UCLA, then why not use it? I think is the main thing, but it's also, for example, UCLA gives you Microsoft Outlook for free. And I don't know how to use it either, and I think it depends like, how much you actively try to look for it. But I think a lot of people use it, like whoever I was working with on the Micro project today."
