1,D,,"So can you first tell us a little bit about yourself? Your name, your age, um, your job/occupation, and then what you tend to do in your free time to keep yourself busy, what you're interested in, what activities you're involved in."
2,Lauren,,"Um, I'm Lauren. I'm 19 years old. I'm a student at Yale, and what I do in my free time, I'm a member of the acapella group the New Blue, so I do a lot of just organization and management for them. I enjoy going on runs. I enjoy going on walks as well. Reading. And generally spending time outdoors."
3,D,,"Awesome. Um. So my first question for you is, um, do you use Canva and what kinds of circumstances have you used it for in the past?"
4,Lauren,,"Um, I use it not often, but I have used it before. I've used it usually for flyers for events. So often those are events for New Blue or for other extracurriculars. We've also used it for—during New Blue Rush—we used it for our info packets on the members and also for like just general information, like packets and flyers for Rush. I'm trying to think of… I have used it for class, for presentations. I think that's it."
5,D,,"Awesome. Okay, do you have Canva Pro by any chance?"
6,Lauren,,I do not. I don't think? I know—um.
7,D,,"And then, are you aware that Yale partners with Canva for a platform called Canva Campus where students get free Pro features?"
8,Lauren,,I did not know that. No.
9,D,,"Are you aware of Canva’s education, um, specifically education features or plans?"
10,Lauren,,No.
11,D,,"Um, great. Okay. Um, so what is the biggest value Canva provides for you currently? Why do you use Canva?"
12,Lauren,,"Um. I guess it's just, like, easier to make flyers on it than it is on other websites. The designs are like pre-made. There's no need to like really download them. You just kind of edit them yourself. Also, it's just like, um, it was easy to share the site and like to share the flyers and like edit at the same time during Rush, which was necessary. Um. Yeah, I think also it's just, like, a matter of ease, 'cause like, you could make presentations and flyers on Google Slides, but um, usually those are like—you have to download a template and then put it in—whereas Canva has all of those kind of pre-made, which I think is nice."
13,D,,"Great. And then on the flip side, what are some reasons why maybe you would stop using Canva? Have you switched to other design tools before? If yes, which ones and why?"
14,Lauren,,"I don't think I have, but I guess like the only reason I would stop using it is because I would no longer need it. Like, um… I don't have any—like, I wouldn't… If there was like a thing I had to design, I would probably just like immediately go to Canva to do it. The only reason I would see myself like stopping using it for like the things I've been using it for is like just because I won't need to use it."
15,D,,"Okay. And then along that same line, what do you find are some of your current pain points when using the Canva platform?"
16,Lauren,,"Um… hmm. I think sometimes like editing it can be a little finicky. Like, like it's not always easy to edit sometimes—like editing certain things. Like, or the fact that you need Pro to do other things when you don't have it, which is like, I guess, on me for not getting it, but I don't want to buy it. And at least at the beginning, it was a learning curve to share it and like figure out where to locate shared documents or shared flyers when we were like collaborating on documents together."
17,D,,I see. So what are some changes or improvements that you think Canva could make to fit your needs better?
18,Lauren,,"I mean like… I can't think of any off the top of my head that aren't like fixable just by me myself. Like, like the sharing thing, it was like—I guess like just maybe organizationally making that easier to find on the homepage. But otherwise it's like literally just me not wanting to get Pro. And so… yeah."
19,D,,"Great. Okay. Um, and then you're a college student now, but have you used Canva in other educational periods of your life and has your interaction and engagement with Canva changed at all?"
20,Lauren,,"Um, yes, I have. I used it in high school for similar purposes. Even outside of school, I was part of a committee that was doing like organizing donations, so I used it for that, like flyers and presentations. I've used it for both of those before, outside of college. But it hasn't really like—I don't think the way I've interacted with it has changed much."
21,D,,"Okay, cool. Um, are there any other kind of qualms you have, or maybe good things about Canva that you want to point out, or anything that you want to touch on that I haven't asked you about?"
22,Lauren,,No.
23,D,,"Okay, great. Thank you so much, Lauren."
