1,Frank,,Let's get started. How long have you been using Canva?
2,Michelle,,I started using Canva as a freshman in high school. That's probably year 5 or year 6 now.
3,Frank,,How were you introduced to Canva?
4,Michelle,,"I was in student council in high school, and they told me I had to make a flyer for the first time as a freshman. I needed to find out how to make flyers, and then I realized Canva existed. It was probably other students or a teacher who told me. I didn't have Canva Pro at that point."
5,Frank,,When did you get Canva Pro?
6,Michelle,,"I was a sophomore or a junior when my student council advisor, the student activities manager, figured out that you could do a classroom. She gave all of us the Canva code so we could be on her classroom."
7,Frank,,How frequent would you say your use for Canva is?
8,Michelle,,"In different stages of my life, it's been different. My junior year, I was secretary for student council, and all I did was make flyers, so I made more than one every week. Now I make about one or two flyers a week."
9,Frank,,What's your major? Do you do any design-related stuff?
10,Michelle,,"No, my major's Economics and Global Affairs."
11,Frank,,"So when you go to the professional world, you probably wouldn't be looking at roles like social media manager or design-heavy positions?"
12,Michelle,,Probably not.
13,Frank,,"When you used Canva before to make those flyers, what drove you to use Canva? What made you stay?"
14,Michelle,,"I'm not a graphic design person. Those people gravitate towards Adobe or Creative Cloud. For me, with no experience, that's too technical. Canva is great because you can get somewhat technical with experience—background remover and other features—but it's still user-friendly. I just play around with it, and that's all the training I need."
15,Frank,,Do you see yourself using Canva more or less in the future?
16,Michelle,,"I really like nonprofits, and they use it a lot even if you're not a design person. For example, I interned with my El Paso Community Foundation two summers ago. I didn't go in for graphic design, but when they found out I could make a flyer, that's all I was doing. It's not my experience or interest, but it comes with the kind of work I'm interested in—nonprofit work or smaller local organizations."
17,Frank,,"So the biggest value Canva provides you is that it's easy to use, and since you're not a graphic design-type person, you can still make things look good and aesthetic?"
18,Michelle,,"Yes. I also like how many pre-made designs they have. There's no barrier to entry. Once you get more familiar with it, you can look through designs for ideas, replicate them, and change what you want. I'm not limited to what they have but can still take ideas."
19,Frank,,Have you ever used any other designing software like Figma?
20,Michelle,,"No. I might have tried one once, and I didn't like it. I don't remember why. It must have been not as easy, and I never went back."
21,Frank,,"When I was using Canva, one frustration was transferring from one school account to another. I couldn't bulk copy my templates. Did that happen to you?"
22,Michelle,,"No. I always used my Gmail because I knew my high school account would be deleted. I never used my school district account for Canva, Quizlet, or other things."
23,Frank,,"When you went to Yale, did you continue using your personal Gmail?"
24,Michelle,,"For emails, I use my Yale account. For accounts not connected to other people, I use my Gmail. It keeps my Yale inbox cleaner."
25,Frank,,"When you're using Canva, did you have any frustrations?"
26,Michelle,,"I haven't run into anything that frustrates me. If I wanted to transfer designs, that might be frustrating, but I've never needed to do that."
27,Frank,,What do you think Canva could do better? Is there a feature that could be improved or added?
28,Michelle,,"Maybe a training feature. I've had to mess around with things until I figured them out. Maybe they do have a training thing, and I haven't looked at it, but a crash course or option to revisit it would be helpful. For example, I didn't discover the background remover until year 3 or 4. It would have been useful to know earlier."
