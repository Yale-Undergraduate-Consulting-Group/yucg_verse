1,Queena,,"Um, that I… that I use quite a lot. So that… That's why I used Canva for the, um, text feature, but I wasn't really able to edit much. I think it might be because of the layering option, or I… it just felt, like, really laggy when I was using it."
2,Frank,,"Oh, for video editing?"
3,Queena,,"Yeah. Yeah, for video editing."
4,Frank,,"Mmm, okay. Oh, okay. Cool."
5,Queena,,"And… let me see, I don't think I could import a very long video and… make it background transparent, which was one of the downsides. Like, I wish they could allow me to upload, like, infinite amount of time, like… Final Cut Pro, they don't… they don't put a cap on how much time you import, like, the footage. So… but I don't know if it's because of the way they operate, if they put it into cloud, and it's too much storage for them, or something, but… Yeah, for our user's perspective, we don't really think that much. We're just like, oh, it's not allowing me to, I'm switching to another software."
6,Frank,,"Yeah, exactly. Um, so… Just to get a better overview. What are some of the other apps or features as a designer, as a student, that you've used alongside Canva? or you think are similar to Canva, or you… like, think could replace Canva."
7,Queena,,"Um, one of them, I would say, I actually… oh yeah, before I paid the subscription for… for the Canva, I would… I would go to about it this way. I would use my iPad to draw it myself. Like, I would reference the template that Canva has. Template is such a strong asset in Canva. Because of how professional it looks for some of them. And then I would just draw it, like, using the same shape, same color, and then I would draw it onto, like, um… That's like, what is it called? Let me see. I think Procreate. That's… that's what it's. Um, I feel like… Procreate is so nice if you want to, like, hand draw stuff, it's really nice. And also, yeah, I use Canva for thumbnail making for YouTube videos. And sometimes I want to add those, like, hand-drawn details to make it look a bit more, you know, handmade, personal. Um, I have to use, like, um… the cursor to draw it, and it's slightly, like… it's not… it's not as customizable, like, the pen options aren't that many. And it's, like, all limited to probably, like, 3 options, and they have, like, very specific functions, like, for example, they… I don't know if you know the, um, streamline function, but they would, like, When you draw, you don't have, like, the full control over it. They would, like, kind of curve you back to where your previous like drawing is, so it's kind of like that. Um, I wish they have, um, I don't know, I haven't used it on iPad, but if they have an option to, like, draw stuff nicely on Canva, that would be nice. It doesn't have to be, like, very elaborate. It could be just, like, Um, just, it could be just, like, good notes. Like, we're… we're the pen functions or something is slightly more customizable, but not to the extent of park rate. But it then would be enough for me like, handwrite stuff, because, like, I feel like I'm able to draw, like, tiny little stars or tiny little outlines, but then it wouldn't be enough for me to write, like… happy, or something, like, without making them look very… like, obvious that I'm writing it with my trackpad."
8,Frank,,"Okay. Yeah, that makes sense."
9,Queena,,"And also, it's slightly limited in terms of, like, the pen functions, like, you can't change how it's tapered, like, towards the end, I think it's just, like, if you let go, then it's like a sharp ending instead of, like, around edges, which I know this is, like, so, like, minute, but, like, sometimes those stuff just… matters."
10,Frank,,"Got it. Do you think going to a professional setting when you're in college or looking for SARPs or whatever, and when you go to a professional setting once you graduate college, when you land a real job. Do you think he'll keep using Canva?"
11,Queena,,"Okay, the thing about that is it's actually very dependent on the workspace, so I think it, like, from the perspective that I look at now, when I think about it, It would also be like, oh, it's my personal choice, and I can choose between the different workspace, but when… in the actual company, they would give you instructions to, like, use Figma, or use Photoshop, or use Canva. And that's also because of the fact, if they have subscription for it, and then people can, whether they can collaborate on it. So, I feel like, in terms of the industry, if… If the company itself is reluctant in changing, or, like, using that as a team, then you wouldn't be using it. So it's less of a matter of personal choice, but more of, like, if the company operates on it or not. And for… for… as for my experience so far in working at startup, they're very flexible. And if you want to use Canva Pro, they would give you Canva Pro, like, they would give you a budget, and you can… they can work within that. Um, but… for a more, like, I don't know, for more… bigger company or more established one, I think if they already have a system in place, It'd be hard to convince them to switch, unless for a compelling reason."
12,Frank,,Okay.
13,Queena,,And they usually wouldn't require you to work within the workspace. For purposes of collaborating and also consistency.
14,Frank,,"Mm-hmm. So, for the current university level of professionalism, Would you keep using Canva coming from high school curriculars to uni clubs?"
15,Queena,,"Okay, that's interesting. Because the clubs that I'm in right now, it's more… okay, I'm in the Trojan news, which I'm part of the video editing team. For video editing, I won't be using Canva, just because of how limiting it is. And I'll be using… Uh, like, I think even iMovie would be better, honestly. Um, so I would be using Final Cut, as usual. And then for… Marketing purposes, um… I'm think… we haven't started actual marketing yet, because we've been doing branding for the past 2 months, but moving into that, I think I might be for posts, because of the fact that it's still very nice for… quick and easy, um… layouts. Um, I think Figma, for me, for that, is just way too unnecessarily complicated."
16,Frank,,Right. Yeah.
17,Queena,,"And I think Canva just has better layouts and better templates. So I think for that, I would. Um… But other… otherwise… and for YouTube thumbnails, I still would be using Canva, just because of just how ease of use it is for background removing. That itself, like, it's solely, like… That kind of movie, like, that one feature sold me, because of just how incredibly good it is, but yeah. Um… Yeah. For other ones? Nope, I don't know."
18,Frank,,Okay. What would you say your design service using percentage transitioning from highschool to university was like?
19,Queena,,"Okay, I think… Canva definitely peaked for me in probably grade 11. Just because there were so many events, banners we have to make, and the fact that we had to make them in rapid successions, and, like, it's one after… So, Canva was so nice for us to make sure that, um, the kind of theme was on point, because we could just, like, you know, copy and paste it over into another template, and then maintain the font, maintain the color scheme, And we can transition from the PowerPoint to making a banner. So that's, like, the really nice option of that, and… Um, afterwards, I haven't been using it as much because I've been also… For us to, like, use Figma, for example, or to use other softwares, so it's, like, slightly declining. It used to be, like, 100% Canva. And then now it's slowly transitioning into, like, also having to learn other softwares."
20,Frank,,"Okay, got it."
21,Queena,,"Probably still, like, 60% Canva, because of just how… how… how, like, how much I've been using it in the past, and most of my past works has been on it."
22,Queena,,"Oh yeah, and also one thing that's very confusing is you know how there's, like, workspace within Canva? And I can't transition it from one workspace to another. For example, if I've been using Mr. Kwong's workspace, and I've been having Hemet stuff in there, which is my company."
23,Frank,,Mm-hmm.
24,Queena,,"I've been using it there, um, and we have… now have a Hemo workspace. I can't really transition it into that. Like, or I don't know how to in an easy way. That's what's quite frustrating."
25,Frank,,"Okay, I totally agree, that was one of the things that was frustrating for me as well transitioning to a Yale email account. Has that been a big issue for you?"
26,Queena,,"Yeah, it really has… I’ve been using my old LMS account for Canva for so long, and since its non-existent now, there’s almost 100 files on a non-existent account right now. And I don't want to lose them all, but, like, I have, like, no way to deal with it."
27,Frank,,"Hmm. Okay, cool. Wait, so have you tried transitioning from one email account to another?"
28,Queena,,"I have, but I don't think it ever worked. I'm not sure why. I think I tried, like, probably 2 or 3 times by now, but… The last time I tried, I think it just made me, like, give up. So this is not happening."
29,Frank,,"Ok, thank you so much for your time. That was a very long time. Um, I'll end the recording now, so this will be the end of our formal interview."
