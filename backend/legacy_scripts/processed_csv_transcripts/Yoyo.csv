1,Frank,,Do you mind if we disclose your demographic information? Your age and your gender?
2,Yoyo,,"Yeah, sure, that's fine."
3,Frank,,"Okay, great, thank you. Cool. Then, first question is, how long have you been using Canva for?"
4,Yoyo,,"Um, I've probably been using Canva for at least, like, 8 years since, like, grade 4."
5,Frank,,"Did you ever have a premium account? Did you pay for them, or did you always… have you always used a free account?"
6,Yoyo,,"Um, I never paid for it, I just got a free premium account from my high school, yeah."
7,Frank,,Where did you get this free account from?
8,Yoyo,,"I mean, like, my school kind of provided it, but then, like, Okay, like, they provided it when I was in, like, grade 10 or something, so before that, I just used it for free, like, I never really paid for it."
9,Frank,,"Okay, got it. Do you remember which teacher you got Canva Premium from?"
10,Yoyo,,"Um, I think my school just sent me an email, and then they were like, oh, if you're, like, interested in this, you can sign yourself up, but there's, like, limited, like, spots for it, and I just, like, got it, like, immediately."
11,Frank,,"Um, yeah. So, you've always been using Canva for a while. What do you normally use Canva for?"
12,Yoyo,,"I guess, I feel like Canva's really useful if you're, like, making, like, low-stakes social media posts, especially for, like, different clubs or, like, For, like, I guess, like, school clubs, too. I don't think it's, like, the best kind of, like, platform for making more advanced design, but if I'm just doing it for, like, I really, really, like, mini project, and I'll probably use Canva."
13,Frank,,"Then, specifically, could you describe how you use Canva? How is Canva used as a part of your workflow when designing posters, websites, flyers?"
14,Yoyo,,"Okay, for flyers and, like, for graphic designs in general, like, Canva's good, because, like, especially if you want to make it, like, in a really short time, because they provide you, like, things like templates. Which is, like, quite useful, but if we're talking about, like, website design, like, it's really, really hard to navigate. Like, Figma, I use Figma instead, because, like, Figma is, like, made professionally for, like, making, like, UI design and things like that, so I feel like that would be more useful than Canva."
15,Frank,,"Okay, got it. Could you list all the design services you use?"
16,Yoyo,,"All the softwares I use? Okay, um, I use Canva, I use Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop. Um, I use Figma. And then there's, like, a bunch of, like, um, kind of, like, 3D modeling things I do. Like, I use, um, Fusion 360 Nomad Sculpt. I also use a bit of Blender. Oh, and then there's… there's just things like drawing and editing stuff, like Procreate, and then, like, Final Cut Pro and DaVinci Resolve for, like, videos and stuff. Yeah, that's basically it."
17,Frank,,"Wow. The reason I ask is because I want to know how much of each software do you use, or do you rely on? What would be the percentage distribution of the time you spend usinh these different services?"
18,Yoyo,,"It really depends on, like, the purpose, like, for… okay, like, for just, like, basic social media posts and stuff, I'll definitely use Canva, and that's probably, like, Like, 30% of the time, And because I've, like, I do a lot of UI more than a graphic design, I probably use, like, use, like, like, 50% of Figma. And then I feel like the rest… I said 30% for Canvas, so, like, the rest, like, 20%..."
19,Yoyo,,"I feel like it's more like Adobe Illustrators and stuff, because, um, like, I also applied to, like, a bunch of, like, clubs, like, for media, like, roles, and they told me that they don't accept Canva. Like, they only use Adobe Illustrators and things like that."
20,Yoyo,,"Yeah, I specifically asked that. Yeah, because I feel like, um, I think it's mainly because, like, Canva, it's like, they provide you so many templates, and it's just, like, really easy for you to just, like, replicate designs that are, like, not that original. So they were like, oh, use Adobe Illustrator because it's, like, more unique, I guess."
21,Frank,,"Oh, okay. Wait, I didn't know that. So, the clubs and universities, the ones you apply to actually specifically said don't use Canva, use Adobe Illustrator?"
22,Yoyo,,"Um, I asked them, like, oh, do you guys usually use Canva, or do you accept, like, using Canva for it? And they're like, oh, we still prefer Adobe Illustrator, and we barely use it. So basically, we're not… I was not that allowed to, like, use it, I guess, because it's, like, more, like, illustrator-focused."
23,Frank,,"What do you think you'll be doing in the future, career-wise, and what's your major currently? Do you think you're gonna need to be doing mainly just UI design, graphics design?"
24,Frank,,"Do you see yourself using Canva as you progress into more professional settings, like professional clubs and internships, or when you eventually get a job?"
25,Yoyo,,"I thought Canva would be, like, useful for me in the long term until, like, I feel like when I contacted that club, and they were like, oh, I don't think we really accept Canva, and then so I was like, okay, maybe, like, um, in a professional setting, they don't really like Canva in general, so I feel like I might be switching to… things like Illustrator, and I guess it's just, like, Figma. more, because I feel like… I don't know, I feel like Canva is something for, like, more, like, casual designers and people who just need to design for, like, And, like, at a beginner's level, so I'm not really sure about that, but I, like… If I had to, like, really answer that question, I don't think I would be using Canva in the long term."
26,Frank,,"Could you describe your use of Canva, how frequently have you used Canva since you started to use it, all the way till now, and also how frequent do you think you’ll use it in the future?"
27,Yoyo,,"Okay, um, I definitely use it a lot when I just started, because I wasn't great for it, and I had, like, I had, like, basic, basic knowledge on design, so I felt like it was really useful, because it's super, super easy to, like, navigate, for example, to, like, make shapes and, like, just, like, format them, because it's, like, It's on a… it's on… it's usually used on a website, so it's, like, relatively easy and things like that. Um, and then I feel like when I got to, like, grade 10 or grade 9, I kind of used it, like, extensively. I feel like grade 10, especially because I got, like, the premium account for free, and then that's when I started, like, using it for, like, social media posts and things like that. And I feel like, since I stepped into uni, Um, I use it for, like, my… I think the first social media post I'm doing for, um, a club called Designer Columbia, like, the only club… the design club at Columbia, And then I stopped, and I switched, like, Figma, because, like, I thought it was, like, super hard that I can make it, like, really original."
28,Yoyo,,"So I feel like, in the long term, Um, I might be using less of, like, Canva, maybe? Like, I said 30% in general. I think… I feel like it's gonna drop to, like, 10 or 5. like, maybe next year."
29,Frank,,"So, Canva isn't very suited for what you want to do now, which is more professional work, Is that what I'm hearing?"
30,Yoyo,,"Yeah, I don't think Canva is very professional, because, okay, um, for Illustrator, what's really good about Illustrator is that you can, like, adjust, like, vectors, like, super easily, and you can make, like, really, like, original shapes. Like, Canva does offer that, but it's super hard to, like, navigate, especially when you're, like, forming, like, curves and things like that. And also, um, because, like, Illustrator, it's connected to, like, Adobe, and then functions of, like, Photoshop, so you could easily, like, edit images. Especially with, like, just, like, editing images and, like, lighting, and then, like, shades in general, and I feel like with Canva, I feel like there's… Like, they only give you, like, a few filters, and that's it. So it's, like, really hard if I'm, like, switching between different platforms, like, I'd rather just focus, like, on one platform that allows me to do, like, everything I need."
31,Frank,,"Hmm, okay, got it. So, specifically, you mentioned the filters feature. What other features have you found useful in Canva, and what features like that have you found in comparing… when comparing to other apps have not been so good?"
32,Yoyo,,"Um, I feel like what's good about Canva, like, like, there's probably… I remember… I think there's this, like, section called, like, Elements and stuff, and you can just, like, search up, like, shapes and icons, and you can just directly paste it in there. If you have the premium account, because most of them are, like, not free, which is, I feel like it's good. I mean, Figma has, like, related things, but it's, like… It's, like, part of, like, a plugin, and you have to, like, you have to, like, find it yourself from, like, an icon, like, library and things like that, and their icons are, like, not as diverse. It's Canvas, so probably, if I need to use, like, Figma, I probably have to, like, draw everything."
33,Yoyo,,"Like, when Canva actually provides me, like, the icons already, so I feel like… That's really good about Canva, and I feel like that's why beginners, like, really like to use it, because it's, like, so easy to, like, just pull and then paste it on your design."
34,Frank,,"In my understanding, at the beginning, you just purely used Canva, and when you got more professional, you started using AI, um, and also Figma and other services like that."
35,Frank,,"So, what was the reason you started to switch from Canva to, like, other services, and when did that happen?"
36,Yoyo,,"Um, I feel like, um… that kind of happened in, like, grade 7 or 8, because, like, Because I'd say design, like, throughout my high school years, and then, um, we started to, like, use different softwares, like Adobe Illustrator, And then I think I used Illustrator for, like, my flat pack project, where we had to, like, Well, I guess we had to, like, print parts, and then, like, just, like, assemble them together after, like, laser cutting and stuff, and I felt… I felt like, oh, okay, oh, there'll be illustrator's, like, extremely more useful than Canva, especially where you're looking at, like, dimensions, too. And then you're just making, like, organic shapes instead of, like…like, abstract, like, squares and, like, circles and things like that, so I felt that was really useful, so I kind of just started, like, switching to Adobe Illustrator afterwards."
37,Frank,,"Once you discovered illustrator, why would you continue using it, or why did you decide that it was a good time investment to invest into Figma and Adobe Illustrator instead of just sticking to Canva the whole time? Is it because of extracurricular activities or your personal use, or…?"
38,Yoyo,,"Um, I feel like extracurricular, definitely, personal use, too. Um, I think especially with Figma, because I was more on the UI side, And then the Figma, kind of like… I feel like it's just easier to navigate, because you could put, like, all the pages on the same kind of, like, document, and then you could, like, just scroll through, like, very, like, like, however you want, because for… I think for Figma, if you want to create, like, new pages, it's basically, like, right afterwards, you have to, like, switch back, like, a lot of times. And I feel like for, like, Um, I guess for, like, I feel like for Adobe Illustrator and Figma, they have, like, really good, like, dimension settings and stuff, so I could, like… I could, like, put my, like, pieces, like, exactly… Um, like, on where I want them to be. And for Figma, it's like, they don't have, like… I think they do have grids, But their goods are, like, not that useful, because it's, like, not, like, specific enough, I guess. So if you're like, that's when I really switched to, like, Illustrator and Figma, because I need to be, like, more, like, I guess, like, accurate, um, with dimensions and things, if I wanna, like, work in that kind of field."
39,Frank,,"Mmm, okay. Got it, so what I'm hearing is that… You switched from Canva to Adobe Illustrator and Figma, because Canva grading and dimensions are not very precise."
40,Yoyo,,"Yeah, no, that precise, yeah."
41,Frank,,"Why is precision mattered, or why is it valued in this field?"
42,Yoyo,,"There's a… I feel like in design, like, especially in design, they really focus on things like, like, symmetry and making it everything, like, organized, and then UI-friendly, um, because, like, there's so many websites out there, and if your website does not look, like, symmetrical, or, like, Um, it's like, everything's, like, not structured in a more, like, in an easy-to-navigate way. Like, you basically lose users, so, like, I feel like that's really important, which is, like, really different from arts, because for arts, you could be, like, super abstract and things like that, and people will still, like, look at your thing. But for design, because there's so many websites out there, if you don't make it, like, super easy to navigate immediately when you, like, pop up to their homepage, you basically lose users instantly. So I feel like that's why it's so important to make it super precise and, like, super symmetrical in terms of, like, numbers, too, and just, like, not, like, when you look at it. To, like, make sure that every user is comfortable with it, because you don't know if, like, there's users who's, like, super picky about design and just, like, just, like, looking at, like, oh, how, like, symmetrical it is."
43,Frank,,"My next question would be… what's normally… what's typically your design purpose? Are you normally making websites? Are you normally making flyers? Or has that been, like, transforming throughout your whole lifecycle as well?"
44,Yoyo,,"Um, I feel like it really depends on what type of design, because I do graphic design, I do UI design, and I used to do, like, a bit of, like, product and, like, architectural design in high school, but just for, like, project-based and things like that. Um, I feel like currently I'm doing a lot of, like, graphic design and media things, and then I'm starting a, like, a more, like, UX and, like, service design project, and I feel like that's, like, kind of, like, my purpose, I guess, like… Just to make, like, it really depends on the project I'm currently being assigned to. Because of… yeah, because I feel like I'm getting more, like, project assignments and, like, initiating them currently, so, like, I feel like it's… It really depends on, like, what type of design I'm going for."
45,Frank,,What are some of the specific pain points or frustrations when you use Canva?
46,Yoyo,,"Um, I feel like… I would definitely, like, dimensions, and then, like, making sure everything's, like, really precise. And then there's also the idea of being original with design, um, because there's, like, a bunch of templates. And, like, when I first started Canva, Um, I definitely find myself just using these templates and kind of, like, switching things up, but it's, like, not really original. And if you think about it, there's so many users who, like, use Canva, and then at one point, you'll probably see, like, almost identical design on, like, on web, if you're, like, actually, like, using templates from, like, Canva, which is, like, a really bad thing. For designers, because we're basically taking… taking away, like, their originality and then their creativity. Which is kind of, like, one of my concerns, but it's also, like, one of the best parts about Canva, if you're not a designer and you just want to, like, make a design. Like, really fast, and things like that. And then there's also the idea of, like, photo editing and things, and then just, like, making, like, unique, like, vectors and shapes. Which is, like, my main… also, like, one of my main concern. But I feel like other than that, it's okay."
47,Yoyo,,"Oh, and I also, like, I think… Canva added, like, this AI editor thing. Like, AI bar or something, like, in their thing, where it, like, literally just, like, you can put, like, keywords in there, and they help you generate design. And personally, I don't really like that idea, because it's basically not your design anymore, it's like the AI's design, and then your prompt and everything together. I don't really… like that, but I feel like I know why they would put that in there, because, like, basically, most websites… They're integrating, like, AI helpers and stuff, but I just don't feel like it's the best way with design."
48,Yoyo,,"Which is why I'm, like, still more focused on, like, I guess illustrators and things, and I do know that Figma, they also do have, like, AI editors and stuff, but I feel like they come as a plugin. So, like, if you don't download the plugin, you basically don't use it. But then for Canva, it's, like, right there, like, on the left panel, so I feel like it's really easy for people to just, like, directly, like, start using it. Also, like, for designers and stuff. I don't feel like that's the best idea, but I do get why they put them there, yeah."
49,Frank,,You said something about hard-to-form specific unique vectors or shapes in Canva. Why is it important to form unique vectors and shapes from a designer's point of view?
50,Yoyo,,"Um… okay, because, like… Mmm… I feel like a lot of designs, like, out there, they basically use the same shapes. It's, like, squares in the circles, and then just, like, basic curvy lines. And I feel like if you really want to be unique with it, I feel like it's really important for you to know how to, like, make your own shapes, and especially make it really according to, like, what… I feel like, like, what you actually need, like, for example, for, like, for the club I'm currently in, for Design at Columbia, um, We use, like, specific, like… we don't use specific shapes, like… I mean, we do really focus on consistency and things like that, but, like, We like to add, like, different shapes, just to, like, really catch people's, like, like, kind of, like, eyeballs, in a sense, because there's so many, like, clubs out there that basically, like, okay, like, for example, like, finance clubs, they basically just use, like, squares and, like, squares like rectangles and stuff, and then that's basically their purpose, because they want to look, like, professional."
51,Yoyo,,"But for, like, Designer Colombia, we want to make it, like, more unique. So then, like, I feel like making, like, unique backstairs is definitely a way to do so. And also, um… I feel like a lot of people use Canva to make logos, and if you want to make a really unique logo, you definitely need to use, like, bacteria's and unique shapes. Because, like, you… because there's only, like, so many ways to combine, like, shapes like squares and circles to make, like, a logo, and if you want to make something that's actually unique, you definitely need to use, like, like, factors in, like, unique shapes, so I feel like that's why, like, I thought it was quite a big concern for me."
52,Frank,,"Regardless, these pain points, so you said it's hard to create unique figures and shapes, it's hard to be precise on Canva, which is bad for retaining users. And it's also, um, Canva also has an AI feature that takes, so hey, originality and creativity. You also said before about the filters. Um, I think I also interviewed Quina, and Queena also said something about the filters, and… What are your thoughts on them? Why are they bad? Is it just because there's not enough?"
53,Yoyo,,"Um, okay, I feel like… Canva filters and Instagram filters are, like, really similar, because when you, like, post stories, and then you, like, swap through the filters, there's basically, like, 5 or 6, and they're, like, either, like, super saturated, or they're, like, black and white. Um, I feel like that's really difficult to use sometimes."
54,Yoyo,,"So, like, if I wanna, like, really use Canva for, like, design purposes, I probably need to, like, switch, like, Photoshop, or other things like Snapseed to, like, edit, like, photos, and then put… and then paste them in. Which was, like, you really don't want to, like, use two different, like, softwares when you can basically use one, which is the case with, like, Illustrator. So I feel like that's quite, like, a big concern, too."
55,Frank,,"Okay, understood."
56,Frank,,"So, the idea is that the camera filters are way too Instagramy. They make it look unprofessional."
57,Yoyo,,"Yeah, you could tell it's, like, it's more for, like, casual purposes."
58,Frank,,"Okay. Then, when you get an internship or a job as a professional UX designer, do you know what software industries or startups or companies usually look for, or prescribe for designers to use."
59,Yoyo,,"Okay, like, definitely Adobe, like, the whole set of Adobe, because they're, like, super professional with what they do. And then I feel like Figma, it's really debatable, because I know some companies do not like it, because they feel like it's also a bit, like, Canva-ish, but of course, it's like, It's, like, more like… it's definitely, like, more professional, and you do have, like, more flexibility with it, and you… basically, UI designer, they start with Figma when you do, like, basic, like, wireframing. But if you want to actually, like, go into them, Um, you basically… I feel like you need to use, like, more, like, other softwares, but I feel like it really differs for, like, depending on the company, but I feel like Figma, it's like, for starters, and probably internships, I feel like that's enough. And then I feel like it blends into, like, Adobe quite well, so I feel like it's basically those two. And then, I don't think you use Canva unless you work in Canva. Yeah."
60,Frank,,"Okay. In your experience, um, have you ever met a professional? UI UX designer, that usually, like, hinges a lot on Canva."
61,Yoyo,,"Um, no, I don't think so. Like, the president, um, at my Designer Columbia Club, she's currently interning in the… like, at Adobe, and then basically they don't mention Canva at all, and they don't like Canva."
62,Frank,,"Okay, so I'm assuming, unless it's, like, just a startup, or they don't have enough expertise or money, or it's, like, in a tech or finance startup, if they really care about the professionality of their designs, they wouldn't really go to Canva. They would go to Adobe, they would go to Figma."
63,Yoyo,,"Yeah, if they have, like, extremely, like, high design requirements, and then if they think, like, oh, graphics is a big thing, that, yeah, they would use Illustrator, but if they don't…Probably Canva."
64,Frank,,"Okay, understood."
65,Frank,,"I guess in a future setting like that, in what scenarios do you see yourself? Like, why would you keep on using Canva in the future?"
66,Yoyo,,"I feel like for, like, personal reasons, for example, if I'm gonna throw, like, a birthday party or something, and then I basically… I don't… I don't really need it to be, like, that professional, I'll probably just go in, like, something on Canva. I guess I'm definitely… I don't think I'm gonna use it for, like, club purposes or things like that, unless it's something, like, super casual. Like, um, for example, if I'm… because I'm at Designer Columbia, like, there's no way I'm gonna use Canva. For that, because it's, like, so design-focused. But for example, if it's, like, for, like, a cultural club, like, for example, like a Hong Kong club, Like, and they want to host, like, a mixer, or, like, a party or something. Okay, they will probably use Canva, because it's so easy to use, and it's so, like… quick to just form a poster. Um, and I guess another reason why I might still use Canva in the future is, for example, like, if there's so many, like, events that's gonna happen, like, each week, and I really don't have the time to, like, really navigate to, like, Illustrator or, like, Figma a lot, then I'll probably just, like, put it in Canva for, like, low-stakes stuff."
67,Frank,,"Okay. I just wanted to ask this again, but except for the frustrations and pain points you said about using Canva before Personally, when I was using Canva, when I had to switch from accounts, like, our school changed from LMS to a student.isf.edu, and then at my university, and I had my personal account. I actually have, like, 3 or, like, four separate Canva accounts, one for my professional personal account, one for my… Like, the one I created back in grade 2. I have also my LMS and Zoom one, so when I was trying to transfer designs, and I was trying to, like, switch email accounts, I was really difficult for me. I don't know if you've ever had that experience with, like, transferring batches of design templates or switching email accounts."
68,Yoyo,,"Okay, I… yeah, definitely, I hate it a lot. Um, okay, okay, um, something I noted, because we switched from, like, LMS to, like, just, like, student account in general, right? Um…my, like, a lot of my designs, like, I feel like it was really weird, because when I, like… there's this option called, like, sign in using Google, right? And then, like, my email popped up, it was, like, student… it was, like, the student account email, which was supposed to be the right one, but whenever I use, like, um, sign in through Google, it transfers me to my LMS account, which is, like, super annoying, because that one's, like, not… that one's, like… I don't have, like, the premium function in that one. And I had to, like, switch back and then sign in manually, like, I have to type my email up manually, or, like, student account, and then I need… I remember so clearly that I need to…Um, like, get a verification code every time I sign in if I do it manually, but that's the only way. So it gets, like, really annoying at one point. But right now, I feel like it's fine, because, like, I switched completely to, like, a university account. So that's okay, but it was just really annoying for me doing high school."
69,Frank,,"Okay. Then, have you ever had to, for example, share a batch or transfer a batch of designs or templates from one account to another? And what was your experience with that?"
70,Yoyo,,"Honestly, I haven't… I did it with my LMS and, like, my student account. It was really annoying, because, like, there's… you send, like, invitations and stuff, and then especially when you're sharing it with, like, other collaborators, Um, and it's like, I feel like it's just harder to navigate because, like, especially when you want to make someone a viewer or an editor, it's just super hard to, like… really, like, um, really, like, do that, and then just differentiate between that, because I feel like for, like, for example, for Google, it's just really easy to just click, like, comment or editor and stuff. But I remember with, like, Canva, I did have issues with that at first, but afterwards it was okay. And then currently, um, currently I don't really need to, like, transfer, like, projects and stuff across my high school account to my uni account, because it's a completely different thing like that. So I feel like that's not my major concern, but I will definitely see it as something that's, like, a problem. If you're, like, in high school and you're switching between accounts."
71,Frank,,"Okay. What do you think, then, as a designer? If Canva wanted to, let's say, keep users from transferring high school to University, or from university to a more professional setting, what improvements do you think Canva could make?"
72,Yoyo,,"Honestly, I feel like they could make things, like, they could add a better grid system that makes everything more precise. Um, and I feel like… maybe make AI a plugin? I'm not sure. I feel like people will still use it, and it's already there, so it's, like, really hard to, like, modify it. And I feel like it really depends on the purpose, because I feel like, um… If Canva switched to something more like Illustrator, people will not… I feel like people… it doesn't make people want to use Canva more, because Illustrator's already there, and it's, like, something that's always been there. And I feel like what makes Canva special is just how easy and simple it is for people who are not professional to use it. And I feel like, um, other platforms don't… are not as good as Canva in doing so, just to make things, like, really simple. So I feel like that's… that's something that makes Canva, like, really special, and I feel like if they really change it, something more Figma-like, or something more Illustrator-like. People still won't use it, so I I feel like they could improve a few functions, like image filter and stuff like that, but I feel like they could also keep, like, the idea of, like, templates. And things like that, just because, like, that's what makes this, like, so special and so easy to use. So I feel like, um, something for Canva is just to, like, make sure that they still keep it, like, simple, and then, um, easy to use for, like, beginners, but also just to, like, Improve a few functions, but I don't think they need to, like, really, like, drastically change it and to make it all, like, we want this to be, like, something, like, more professional-based, like, I feel like that's not something they should do."
73,Frank,,"Okay. Specifically, I wanted to ask, you talked about the features that create and privileged included the grid and the photo image filter function. What specifically could they do to the image filter function?"
74,Yoyo,,"Um, for example, um, there's, like, photo editing, like, softwares, for example, like Snapseed, which is, like, sponsored by Google, and then they do a lot… they can change, like, Not just they can change, like, brightness, like, contrast, and things like that, they could also, like, modify, like, specific colors and, like, curves and things like that. And I… I remember Canva too, they do have it, but it's, like, just, like, they simplified it a lot. Um… And it's mainly, like, things like just, like, brightness, contrast, and, like, the most basic things you could adjust. And then, like, basic filters. Um, which I felt like was not that good, I guess. So I feel like they could, like, incorporate a bit more, like, kind of, like, professional kind of, like, photo editing, like, functions. Maybe they could check out… maybe check out, like, Snapseed or something, because I feel like that's quite useful, and people do use it, like, do use it a lot. And then there's also this other, like, app called… polar, and then they're super good at making filters, and it's saving filters too. So, for example, if you, like, edit it, like, specifically to how you want, you can save it as a new filter and still use it next time. For example, for a series of photos, so you ensure consistency and stuff. I don't… I don't remember Canva having similar function. I mean, a lot of design softwares don't have that function, so I feel like it would be cool if they could, like, incorporate it."
75,Frank,,"Okay. So, Polar, Snapseed and photo editing, more professional photo editing functions, So, like, because Canva only gives you the basic sliders and filters, right? Um, they could give you, like, more professional filters or more customizable ones. Great! Yeah."
76,Frank,,"Other than those features or functions, what other designing features or functions do you think Canva could improve?"
77,Yoyo,,"I feel like it's… they really, like, push people to pay for good functions. Especially for icons, because honestly, I use Canva a lot, just because they provide icons so easily, and they provide so many different types of icons. Um, but then, like, of course, like, the good ones, you need to pay for them, and that was really annoying. Um, that I feel like that would make people switch out from Canva. Especially, so I feel like… Maybe Canva should, like, still offer a few kind of, like, free icons that are, like, good-looking enough. But I just feel like it's not that… it's not… it's not a great idea to make everything, like, premium-based. I feel other than that, it's okay."
78,Frank,,"Okay, do you know any other features? Like, maybe just not… free or paid ones, but maybe just not, like, oh, the paid ones are better, but some existing… premium features or some existing free features that they can make better than they already are."
79,Yoyo,,"Okay, um, I was just looking at Canva, like, right now, and I realized, um, mock-ups, Like, because as a designer, like, Especially, like, for, like, just, like, 2D design in general, sometimes I do a lot of, like, mock-ups, like, especially, um… For example, like, in high school, if I wanted to print, like, a graphic 2D design on, like, a cup, And I want to see how it looks. Um, I'll probably search up, like, a mock-up, like, editor and things like that, which… Figma does provide, if you import… if your import plugins in.  Um, so you can, like, really simulate how it looks, and especially for, like, UI, you want to put it, like, in, like, a foam. Like a phone frame, like, for example, like, iPhone 17, and you want to see how it looks, like, on a phone. Um, I figured that's really useful if you're making, like, a mock-up. I know Canva does provide mock-up, But then they're, like, the mock-up pamphlets are, like, really… they're… I don't think they're, like, they look quite bad when you put your design on there, and, like, Sometimes the proportions and sometimes the shapes, they just don't look natural. It's like you put something 2D that is flat, Um, directly on something 3D, but the 2D designs still fly, and it doesn't, like, circulate around the 3D, like, form, and that's quite annoying. So I feel like that could definitely be improved on."
80,Frank,,"Okay. Well, when you say that kind of mocks up and wireframes don't look natural, what do you mean specifically by that?"
81,Yoyo,,"Okay, like, for example, I generate a 2D design using, like, Canva, which is good, because they're so good at doing 2D designs. And then I want to see how it looks on something that's 3D. Um, so I… they do have this function where I can import something to the end, they can, like, directly, like, oh, try and make it realistic on, like, a 3D thing. Okay, for the last time I did it, It was on, like, a mug, And then, you know how mug, it's, like, circular. It's like a cylinder, right? And then I have to pay, like, it pays, like, a 2D design on there, And it basically… it was just the 2D design, like, flat with, like, no perspective on there, so it was just, like, a design and a mug. But not, like, a design on, like, the mug in, like, a cylinder and, like, a circular way. That, that really, like, makes it, like, put everything in perspective. Like, they don't really do that successfully. So I feel like that's also, like, another concern."
82,Frank,,"Okay, great, thanks. Well, does other, um, do other services do that successfully, like Figma and AI, do they have a feature where they allow you to wrap a 2D around a 3D design?"
83,Yoyo,,"Um, you really need to find a good plugin for that. Figma's also not that good with it right now, but it really depends on the plugin. Uh, you have to search on the internet and stuff and see if they have, like, good plugins and things. So I feel like, honestly, like, I don't have, like, that much of, like, a high expectation for, like, Figma to really fix it, because it's really hard for, like, once…like, one platform, one software to make everything so good, and, like, everything perfect. So I'm just saying, it's like… Something that they should, like, work on if they already provided that platform, but if they did not, then probably they don't really need to, like… really focus on it."
84,Frank,,"Got it. I didn't know Canva had a mock-up feature where you… It allowed you to wrap it around, or do they don't have that, and you just slapped… you just slap the 3D mug, and you slap a design on it, and they don't have a wraparound feature."
85,Yoyo,,"I think they do. It's like, because I searched it up, I was, like, searching, like, mock-up editor, because I was also looking for a plugin to do that, and then Canva popped up, and it was, like, 3 AI mock-up generator.  And then so it's like, oh, create a mock-up, easy drag-and-drop editor, and then you just, like, you can put it on a t-shirt and stuff. And it's just, like, it's just not that good, I can't lie, like…"
86,Yoyo,,"I think the point is just, like, oh, Canva's still really good, it's super easy to use, um… But, like, it's just, like… I guess it's just not something that I would… I would be using a lot, just because I'm going, like, for, like, the more artistic and, like, design-related, like, career path, but I feel like it will still be, like, really useful for, like, other careers and stuff."
