1,Navaa,,"So feel free to tell us a little bit about yourself; name, age, job, what do you do with your time?"
2,Kaveri,,"My name is Kaveri. I'm 19, I'm a sophomore in college. Um, I go to Dartmouth. I guess my job is that I'm a student, um, and I am studying bio, CS, anthropology, etc, and, and pre-med, yeah, I guess that's it,"
3,Navaa,,"Ok, the big, sort of, like overarching question that kind of shapes the rest of the interview is, would you describe yourself as like a current, active user of Canva; or, would you describe yourself as someone that maybe used Canva in the past, but doesn't anymore, or just doesn't use Canva at all."
4,Kaveri,,I'm definitely like a current active user of Canva.
5,Navaa,,"So first and foremost, I do know that Dartmouth does have a version of Canva for campus, some kind of like Canva premium partnership. So do you personally, through Dartmouth, have a Canva pro subscription, or just on the personal side, like, have you bought your own? And if so, how long have you had it for?"
6,Kaveri,,"Yeah, I have the Dartmouth subscription, and I've had it, I guess, for, like, however long I've been in college. So, like, what, like, a year and a half now,"
7,Navaa,,"What would you say is the biggest value that Canva provides for you currently? And why do you, like, use and choose Canada uniquely."
8,Kaveri,,"I do social media stuff for, um, the debate team that I'm on, as well as for the Global Health Coalition that I lead, and so it's really useful for, like promotional information to like just post like different things that different people are doing. Things that, like my clubs have been doing, and it's like a cool way to reach people, especially on like Instagram and also through email, because you can have like cool flyers and things like that. I feel like I use Canva because it's like, the only design platform that I really know how to use. I guess there's, like, Adobe, but I don't really know if you can make posters on it. I'm sure there's a bunch. I think Canva is, like, one, the most well known, and two, it's very user friendly. And I used it a bunch of in high school, so I'm just kept using it here. And also, like, all of the upperclassmen that I know who had positions that I have now used Canva, so we have the templates and all the things for it. So it's just, it makes sense to just be able to use it."
9,Navaa,,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. We're definitely interested in the sort of like timeline of, if the only thing you've been exposed to is Canva, is the reason you're using it is because, like, a unique feature of Canva?"
10,Kaveri,,"So I can't, yeah, sorry, I can't say because I, like, have not used any other design platforms."
11,Navaa,,"All right, so what are some reasons you would stop using Canva? Have you switched to another design tool before? And if yes, which one and why? That’s a lot of questions. Wow."
12,Kaveri,,"The only other thing I've used is for my research. Well, I used to do cognitive psychology research, and for that research, we would run behavioral studies, and so we need to advertise them to people to be able to come to us and do them. And I used to have to make flyers. And instead of, like, going through all of the like, work of making a flyer on Canva, I just asked chatGPT to make it for me. And it was a lot easier, because I just, like, plugged in the things that I wanted, and it spit me out something. It just took a while, and I had to, like, make a bunch of tweets. But I was very pressed for time, and it was just fast. So I think as llms become more efficient and accurate at making flyers and posters, I feel like it will render Canva a little bit less useful, because also, like, I'm not like, a graphic designer. I'm not someone that wants to be spending, like, a ton of time making flyers on Canva. And I'm like, not a super artsy person. And so like, the quicker I can get something done and post it or put up, the easier it is for me. So that's why I like platforms that just, like, do it for you. Like you feed it the information, and it does it for you. So I think my problem is that like chat GPT is not great at doing it. And I know there's other platforms like like Google, deep seek or whatever. There's like Gemini, well, there's a bunch of different like llms that I'm sure can do similar things. But I feel like once they become advanced enough, then I will probably stop using Canva, or when my subscription ends, because, yeah, then I don't really want to. I feel like Canva Pro is really useful."
13,Navaa,,"Yeah, that actually that feeds into like, two, like, really interesting, like, sort of auxiliary questions, like, so Canva does have AI features right now, right? Do you find yourself using those? And would you appreciate more AI features specifically? What do you see as like, the relationship between your use of Canva and then, like, AI?"
14,Kaveri,,"I want more AI features. I just wanted to do it for me. Like, I want to give it information, and I just wanted to spit out a flyer for me, because sometimes I also just don't know how I want to design a flyer. I'm like, Just do it, I don't want to have to figure out, like, what color I want and what shape I want, or whatever. Like, I know that Google Slides has this feature where, like, you can design a slide, and then it'll give you explore options, and it'll change the style of the slides for you based on things that it thinks it looks nice to do. I think this has been around for like, 10 years now. Before llms became a huge thing, and I really liked that, I said a lot in like, middle and high school. And I feel like if Canva had something like that where, like, even if you, like, made your flyer and then had, like, suggested options for how to make it better, I don't know. Maybe it does. I'm not, like, very well versed in the Canva features, but I feel like that could be nice, because especially someone who's not, like, super design heavy, I like, would appreciate more aid in trying to design these things."
15,Navaa,,"Got it. Yeah, it’s really interesting to see, like, just like, what the average student does want in terms of AI features, because I think it's something that you know could just be interesting to explore. And then with like, your subscription expiring post grad. Do you see yourself potentially upgrading to Canva pro once that expires?"
16,Kaveri,,"No, yeah, I mean, I don't really know why I'd have a reason to use Canva after I graduate. I'm not, like, managing social media or, like, making flyers for things that's true in the future. I guess in med school or doing research for something I would need to put something up. But I think the peak functionality for Canva, like, the peak demographic that Canva caters to is students or people who have jobs in social media or graphic design or things like that, and my dad is not, like, designing flyers for his job, right? And so I don't really need a Canva subscription. I didn't have a Canva pro subscription in high school, or I don't. Did Newton South have a subscription? I don't know. I don't think we did, but I'm just like, I don't really like, I don't really think I do, and I think if I needed to use Canva, I'm not gonna---the once a year I might need to use Canva I'm not gonna pay for a subscription."
17,Navaa,,"I get it. With your current usage of Canva, do you see that as like, like you mentioned only using it for flyers and things of that nature. Do you find yourself using Canva for anything like academic at all? Like, I know of some people that do projects on Canva pretty often. Is it something you find yourself doing? Are you more in the Google ecosystem?"
18,Kaveri,,"Sure, yeah. I mean, I do make some slideshows on Canva. I think Google Slides is generally easier to use in a lot of ways, because there's less features, so I just kind of slap everything on. But also, to be fair, like, I'm probably not the best person to ask this question to, because the vast majority of my classes aren't project based. Like, I'm not a humanities student. I'm not, like, making a ton of projects for class, and my STEM classes, I'm taking exams, and so if I am making slideshows I'm probably doing it really quickly on Google Slides, and not paying too much attention to the aesthetics, just because it's not that important to me. I think the content is more important. But I can also see why some people would care more about it and I definitely cared more about it in like, High School. Also, if I'm like, making a presentation for something fun then, yes, but if it's, like, an academic presentation like I just had, an anthropology presentation that I had to make, and it was just on Google Slides, and I just slapped some photos on there. And I just didn't, I wasn't really thinking about the aesthetics that much, but like, I also made a, I did a presentation in like, AP Lit in high school, and I did care a lot about it, and I thought it was really fun. And I think Canva is really especially great for multimedia presentations when you're trying to embed a lot of different features into it. But unfortunately, like, that's just not the, I don't take classes that really are that project based right now?"
19,Navaa,,"That makes a lot of sense. It does make intuitive sense, like a stem student probably wouldn’t need to be using it as much. And then what do you find are your current pain points when using Canva? What do you think can be like improved about your experience?"
20,Kaveri,,"I think sometimes it's hard to find some of the features. There's just like, a lot going on. I think the user face could be a little bit more minimalistic, I want to say, like, just not have a ton of stuff everywhere. And I'm also just not very tech savvy, and so I'm, like, constantly trying to find different things. Or maybe if there was an easier help manual to look at that you could see what the features are, maybe there is, again, like, I don't know that much, but I just think it may be finding ways to make it easier to search for features."
21,Navaa,,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think as of now, there are some Canva tutorials that are up and, like, freely available, but I really don't think anyone's seeking them out. And going to be like, I should watch a Canva tutorial and, like, how to use this feature."
22,Kaveri,,"Yeah, I don’t want to watch a video to know how to use it. Like, I just want to be able to be like, maybe in a help search thing. Like, how do I make the gradient of this more transparent, or whatever? And then it'll be like, Oh, yeah. I'd be like, click this button to do this. You know?"
23,Navaa,,"Yeah, that makes sense, time wise, for sure. And then, oh, that's another question. What are specific use cases in which you have used Canva for something?"
24,Kaveri,,"Okay, um, when we were doing recruitment to get people to try out for our debate team, I was doing a lot of promotional flyers. Like, when I was making posts about exec boards for different clubs, like, we were putting out flyers. We were putting out Instagram posts with all the people on them. We, also do like, when we're sending out mass emails about fundraisers that we have, or different things that different clubs are trying to do, and we're trying to raise money, we'll put flyers in an email that gets sent out to schools, like, just different things like that."
25,Navaa,,"And then I guess you already touched on this. We did already touch on this. Like, what are some specific changes or improvements that Canva should make to fit your specific needs better,"
26,Kaveri,,"Just making it faster to be able to generate things, especially like posters and Instagram posts and flyers. Things that would just make things more efficient."
27,Navaa,,"Yeah, gorgeous, okay, that is everything on my question list, anything, anything miscellaneous that you feel like you just didn't get to share about Canva?"
28,Kaveri,,"I don't think so. I mean, I think it's pretty cool that it exists. I'm happy that it does. And I think there are people who benefit a lot from it more than I do. But I think it's a really cool platform. And I also think it's like, given, like, there are way more complicated platforms out there, like a lot of the Adobe software, like, I think it's relatively easy to use for, like, a noob."
