1,D,,"So, can you tell us a little bit about yourself, your name, your age, your job, and what you do in your free time?"
2,Kush,,"Yeah, my name is Kush Bhatia. I am 22 years old. I just graduated from Emory University and I work at Visa as a client services associate, and in my free time, I like to explore new restaurants and go to the gym."
3,D,,Great. And can you tell us a little bit about your engagement with Canva as of now?
4,Kush,,"As of right now, I don't use Canva primarily as it's not the biggest use within my day to day job at work."
5,D,,Cool. Have you used it in the past before?
6,Kush,,"Yeah, it was a big thing used throughout my college classes for, like, slide decks to work with people on team presentations and just in my clubs for like marketing reasons."
7,D,,"Hmm. So, can you tell me about when you first started using Canva and why you started using it? I mean, you touched on it in your previous answer, but I'd love to hear more about when you were first exposed to the platform. And yeah, if you could just articulate a little bit more about certain use cases that you used the platform for."
8,Kush,,"Yeah, I think I first really used it when I came to college my freshman year, so I guess four years ago. Okay. When I was trying to join some clubs on campus and I think I applied for one of the marketing positions in one of the business clubs, and I needed to showcase like how I would change what they're currently doing in the club and change it for the future. And I used it mostly for this entrepreneurship club I was in as we were trying to gain clients and gain people to kind of get some funding for our program. So that was the first time I used it."
9,D,,"Cool, I see. So in high school, you didn't have much exposure to it at all."
10,Kush,,"Yeah, I don't think so. No, I don't have any. Yeah."
11,D,,Could I ask what platforms you used instead for like creating digital materials or exploring digital literacy?
12,Kush,,"Mm, good question. I think before that, it was mostly just like using, like Google Slides or... yeah, I know that was mostly like Google Slides. Maybe like Microsoft Illustrator… in school."
13,D,,"Interesting. Okay. In high school, Microsoft Illustrator?"
14,Kush,,"Okay, I know what it was called. I can't really remember what the name was. Okay, but like Microsoft, like... what names... whatever they would have in their…"
15,D,,Cool. Cool laptops. I see.
16,D,,Okay. So it was basically what your school already had and what was like already integrated into your school's educational platforms.
17,Kush,,"Yeah, exactly."
18,D,,"I see. Okay. Cool. My next question for you is: when did you stop using Canva and what changed, what exactly changed that led you to stop using it?"
19,Kush,,"I think it was when I graduated in May of this year. Mm hmm. Because I kind of like I was no longer in college clubs, and I wasn't really in an audience area where I needed to create new digital art anymore. And in my current role, I'm not in that kind of role where I need any marketing tools to talk to clients or, like, showcasing digital arts. So that's kind of been a reason why I haven't used it since then."
20,D,,So have you started using any other tools instead of Canva for any type of digital materials?
21,Kush,,"I guess in a similar way, but kind of different, and I guess incorporated now it's more so like how to illustrate data, which is through like PowerBI and Tableau. So it's not the same as Canva where you're making a flyer, but to illustrate like media in some way, I guess those are the main ways that I would use it now."
22,D,,"Got it, I see. Um, and then I guess when you were using Canva in college, were there any particular challenges or frustrations that made Canva kind of hard to use or less valuable to you?"
23,Kush,,"Yeah, I think early on, when I was using on my own, I wouldn't pay for the service, so there were a lot of barriers to like what you could do and what I wanted to convey through like the digital art. But once I was able to join some clubs, we would pay for the premium package, and then you were able to like get a lot more out of it and do whatever you really wanted to do."
24,Kush,,"But also, like, I was very basic on what I would create. I didn't know like how to use a lot of the tools within Canva. I never like really taught myself. So I guess that's another barrier too."
25,D,,I see. Were you ever considering buying Canva Pro for yourself for personal usage at all?
26,Kush,,"I did consider it and funny enough, now I remember, within school I did take a Canva class."
27,Kush,,"We had a Canva class that I did take, and I had to do it for one semester. So I do remember that now actually."
28,D,,"Interesting. Wait, like there was a class?"
29,Kush,,"Jess—yeah, yeah. So we had like one class that was like you take an Excel class asynchronously for a month or for a semester, and then we had a Canva one, we had an AI one. So I’d take a Canva one one semester."
30,D,,Interesting. Can you explain a little bit more about this class and what it entailed?
31,Kush,,"Yeah, it was mostly how to sell yourself within a corporate setting and within like using a slide deck within Canva, less digital media of like flyers and stuff like that. But throughout the course, it was… and so we just didn't really have a teacher telling us anything, but we had to create a lot of presentations on certain topics that we were passionate about and also record ourselves on a five-minute presentation and upload it for our, like, teacher I guess who would grade us for it."
32,D,,"Hmm, I see. That's super interesting. So the class is for like a corporate context. What is your opinion on Canva within a more professional environment?"
33,Kush,,"Yeah, so I think it's interesting, because I think it is very useful. Because I know the program that I'm in, we have like—my role is called client services—and next month is called client services month for our entire company. And I know the people that are on the marketing team primarily use Canva and they're the ones talking to a lot of senior leadership and executive VPs. And I know it is a strong tool, especially with how AI is being developed into it, so now it's starting a lot easier for a lot of people because they can just put their prompt and now it's connected to like ChatGPT and Copilot."
34,Kush,,So I think it is a really great tool. It just depends on what your role is within corporate America and if you are able to use it or not use it.
35,D,,"Okay, cool. That class is—that's so interesting. I've never heard of like a class that was primarily through Canva, so that's cool. Have you heard in college ever of Canva for Campus or Canva for Education along the same vein?"
36,Kush,,"I don't think so, no. I haven't heard that."
37,D,,"Okay, that's totally fine. And then I guess my final question for you is: would you ever consider coming back to Canva and if so, what would that look like? And if not, why not?"
38,Kush,,"I mean, I think so. I think one, if it's like a personal reason, I could definitely see myself—if I need a reason to create any digital art, I think it is a good reason. I was actually thinking about doing it on my own to use it for like decorative purposes for like a lot of the art I want to have in my room, and I know I can connect it in that way."
39,Kush,,"So on a personal level, yes, I think I would use it. On a professional level, I think if there was ever an opportunity at work where I needed to create something, whether it’s like an employee resource group or if there's an event happening within my— in the Atlanta office or something like that, I would definitely use Canva again."
40,Kush,,"So I do see myself using it again, but not right now."
41,D,,"I see. Okay, cool. Is there anything else that I didn't specifically ask you about that you want to share? If not, that's totally fine."
42,Kush,,"Um no, I think you got it."
43,D,,"Okay, cool. Thank you so much, Kush."
44,Kush,,Of course.
