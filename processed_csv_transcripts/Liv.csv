1,Navaa,,"So, first tell us a bit about yourself.  Name, age, job. What do you do with your with your time?"
2,Liv,,"My name's Liv Amiri.  I'm 19 years old. Oh, it's my birthday, actually. Right now, I'm unemployed.  I am a student. Previously, I've been employed for a PR company, and I've also worked as a museum docent. Um, I currently am a freshman at Yale University and I do a lot of humanities stuff."
3,Navaa,,Would you say that you are a current user of Canva or that you don't tend to use it at all?
4,Liv,,"I would say that over the summer I used Canva and now I have stopped because there hasn't been any projects that I've worked on, but if there was a project that called for it, I would use it."
5,Navaa,,"Got it. So, can you tell me about when and why you first started using Canva and what you used it for? Um, I started using Canva probably in the 8th grade for mostly science classes for labs. Um, we would organize our lab data and everything in Canva. So that's how we would present it and that's how we would turn it in. And then also as I got older for English and history classes, when we needed to do a poster or a kind of slideshow base thing or make a graphic. We would use Canva also for clubs, for recruitment and events and stuff."
6,Navaa,,"Okay, so it sounds like your school definitely had some version of like Canva for education subscription. Can you just like talk me through what specific plan your school had?"
7,Liv,,"Um, I'm not sure what specific one.  I know that our email address allowed us to have like Canva, like a Canva premium, and also like Adobe, all the adobe tools, like Photoshop and stuff. Um, and like a bunch of other also film stuff, like Blender and other film editing tools. So we got like a lot of subscriptions to different things. It's probably a plan through the school where just every student, like they make an agreement with the company and every student gets access through that email until they graduate."
8,Navaa,,"And when you say you submitted things from your science classes, like on Canva, was that partnering or like through some kind of like, like cross-platform collaboration with like a learning management platform, like Schoology, canvas, stuff like that? Or was it directly on the canva platform?"
9,Liv,,"Um, so I would share it with the teacher on the Canva platform, but I would also often submit it in Google Classroom or our black bod program, which had like a lot of our assignments, but yeah, and then when I was working on it with other people, we would work on it in Canada and I would share it with them by email. So it'd be through Google."
10,Navaa,,"When did you stop using Canva, and what changed that led you to stop using Canva, or use it less often?"
11,Liv,,"I'd say that the most helpful thing about Canva is making it very easy to make graphics and like flyers and stuff like that. And I think that during the college prep process, I was in a lot of things where that was required. I was an event planner for a certain club and also for my PR company, I would use Canva. I think I stopped using it because here a lot of my classes don't call for design or recruitment posters."
12,Navaa,,"And when you did use Canva, what were your biggest pain points with the platform?"
13,Liv,,"I used it for I had my own poetry in an art magazine that was online. And the entire thing was formatted through Canva. Um, I will say sometimes it was difficult mass formatting, like if a magazine is 20 pages versus one flyer.  It's harder to streamline a design on multiple pages. I think that, It's a little difficult, the layout of the website. Like, it's not very user-friendly in the sense that all the tools are just like kind of weirdly laid out, and over time, you get familiar with it, but I'd say like a program, like the way Photoshop is designed, it's a lot easier to understand what certain things do immediately rather than playing with it and figuring it out.  Like, you immediately kind of know what the tools do. So it's a little harder in that way."
14,Navaa,,"And did you find yourself, like, using alternative tools like Photoshop or the adobe ecosystem or like other things of that nature?"
15,Luv,,"Yeah, I think that Canva has a lot of limitations, like for that magazine, if I was having to alter a piece of art, I can't really do that in canva, so I would use Indesign. It's a lot more detail oriented.  I don't think Canva is very detail oriented. It's very nice in the sense that it has all of these cutouts and fonts and preset designs and stuff. But if you really want to do that detailed work on a graphic itself, I think that calls for Indesign or Photoshop, if it's at a higher level. It's not very professional."
16,Navaa,,"Got it. Um, and were there any challenges or frustrations that made Canva less valuable for you specifically?"
17,Liv,,"No, I just outgrew it a little bit. I do think it's very helpful when you're doing stuff for school or like for a club or maybe even just if you're making a flyer for a party or something, like that. But when you get to professional things, I think it calls for a more refined tool."
18,Navaa,,"And for those more professional roles or maybe high-level roles that you might occupy now, have you started using any other tools that aren't Canva? And if yes, what do they offer for those specific needs that you might have now that Canva didn't?"
19,Liv,,"As of now, I just think the AI editing things and editing softwares and apps are pretty interesting, and I might turn to that before I use Canva. I mean, now I don't really have any design responsibilities, but I think that if I do get a design responsibility, I'm going to use like a Photoshop.  And then, you know, maybe check out AI before I go back to Canva, but if it's just making a poster, then I would use Canva."
20,Navaa,,"Got it, okay. And what would make you consider coming back to Canva, aside from like what you just listed?"
21,Liv,,"I think if it incorporated more AI, if it had an AI option, I think that'd be kind of cool. If there's not a preset that you like, you can even tell the AI, like, hey, I kind of want this kind of layout with this vibe and these components. Even though it has so many presets, if there's something you have specific that you're looking for, I think would be cool for it to be able to generate that. I think with the layout of the tools that if you hover over, like, I like that in Photoshop, it tells you what it does. I don't know if that's the thing in Canva. But what I do like about Canva, I will say, is when you put input a photo, it puts all of your photos that you've imported in one area. I wish that other apps had that. I don't really know if you can edit the photos in Canada. That might be a cool addition. There's not a ton of like alterations you can make to the actual things you're importing. And I think that that would be helpful."
