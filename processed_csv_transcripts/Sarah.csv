1,Navaa,,"Excellent, so just tell me a little bit about yourself, so your name, your occupation, what you keep yourself busy with in your free time, stuff like that."
2,Sarah,,"Okay. So my name is Sarah.  I'm an after school science teacher at Crossroads school in Santa Monica. I'm also the diversity equity and inclusion coordinator for upper school. Um, and yeah, that's my career and my free time.  I love just putting on workshops for teachers and talking about education. I also am really passionate about nature, so I love spending time with the beach and just anywhere with trees. Um, and yeah."
3,Navaa,,"On a scale from one to three, with one being the least, or, I guess, 0 to 3, with the zero being the least, and 3 being the most, how would you describe your, like, digital literacy, enabled or ability to use technology?"
4,Sarah,,"Yeah, I would say I'm not an expert. I would give myself, like, a 2.5 . I always, like, try and learn and stay up to date with things. So, yeah, I think 2.5 out of three."
5,Navaa,,"Amazing, okay. Um, and would you describe yourself as a current Canva user, and if so, how?"
6,Sarah,,"Yeah, so I use it literally every day. I have my student slideshows, my slideshows for my classes.  I make them on Canva, they're interactive. I give my students access to them. I also assign my students assignments through Canva, like making a digital poster.  Um, yeah, I'm a huge fan. There's, I'm sure there's so much more functionality to Canada. I've tried to, um, attend their, you know, when they have those big events that hasn't worked out yet, but I'm hoping to attend one soon."
7,Navaa,,"Yeah, that's amazing. And, like, on that note, would you say that you find yourself using Canva help guides a lot? And for the design school, or those features that you've used before, what do you think of them?"
8,Sarah,,"So, I think I've used the YouTube tutorials that Canva has. Those are mostly what I use to, like, find out how to use new things or how to do something specific about it, for sure."
9,Navaa,,"What are some reasons why you would stop using the Canva for education that Crossroads offers? And have you switched to another design tool before? If yes, which one?"
10,Sarah,,"I just really appreciate that it's free for teachers and students, and honestly, the accessibility is what makes me use it. And the only reason I wouldn't use it is it was not accessible to teachers and students."
11,Navaa,,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, and what do you find are your current pain points and issues when using Canva?"
12,Sarah,,"Honestly, nothing that I can really think of yet. I've been able to do pretty much everything I've wanted to do on there, embedding videos, assigning stuff, hyperlinking. Um, I feel like it's very user friendly for education. Yeah, I can't, honestly, I can't think of anything that I don't like or I haven't or any issues that I've come across."
13,Navaa,,"So when you're doing, like, more administrative functions on Canva, like, adding students to classes, doing whatever you need to give your students access to Canva, how has that process been for you?"
14,Sarah,,"It's been very easy. I think the thing that I don't like on my end, my institution is, most schools don't make it easy to link Canva assignments to our school website. When I used to use Google Classroom, I think Canva had a lot of linking with Google Classroom.  But now our school wants us to use their own interface called Blackbod, and so that's the only thing, I just wish my school's website allowed for more functionality with Canva."
15,Navaa,,"Yeah, absolutely. When you're doing offboarding, which I understand, is, like, still a manual process, when, like, students move from one grade to the next, or when students graduate from high school. Is that difficult to do, or do you find that students just, like, move their data elsewhere? How does that really work?"
16,Sarah,,"Ooh, to be honest, I haven't experienced that yet. I haven't tried to do that yet. It's definitely something that some educators have done."
17,Navaa,,What are some changes or improvements that you think Canva can make to fit your needs better?
18,Sarah,,"I think maybe having more, like, plug and play lesson plans for teachers, but I know that's not really what it does. It's mostly a design tool. I would just say more functionalities for education that are, like, just in Canva. I'm not too familiar with, like, the polls feature.  I haven't used that yet. I feel like I might have used the quiz future before, but, like, more fun stuff that would make it easier to plug and play lessons, just create my lesson things on Canva."
19,Navaa,,"Yeah, absolutely. And then, um, the last question is really more about AI, so have you used Canva Pro’s AI features, and if so, how have they affected your experience?"
20,Sarah,,"Yeah, I think I've played around with their AI image generator a few months ago, and it was cool. I mean, I have my own definitely feelings about AI, so I try not to use it too much without knowing, you know, the ethical and environmental implications, but I did try it out of curiosity. I don't really find myself needing the AI functionality right now. I don't know if that'll change. I'm sure most people are like this too, but I love just like the slideshow templates that Canva has. And I still haven't found an AI slide show maker tool that has the ability to make slides look so aesthetically pleasing and have all the information."
